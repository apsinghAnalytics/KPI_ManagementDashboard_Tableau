The Tableau Public Dashboard can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aditya.prakash.singh/viz/KPIManagementDashboardSalesandProfit/Dashboard1)

I created this Tableau Dashboard to showcase my practical skills in Tableau Visualization, which I acquired through the Coursera course '*Creating an Interactive KPI Management Dashboard*' in Tableau.

The following skills were gained: 
- Created conditional IF/ELSE calculated fields similar to measures in Power BI for **KPIs like YTD Sales, YTD Profit, Profit Margin**  
- **Filtering through a map visualization**: Users can click on any region of the United States map in the visualization, allowing them to apply this filter to the other visualizations
- **Implemented sparklines** to offer quick insights and trends in Year-to-Date (YTD) sales and profit.
- Implemented **sparklines** to provide quick insights and trends in Year-to-Date (YTD) sales and profit.
- Developed **dual-axis bar charts** for comparing current YTD performance with the prior year, making trend identification easier.
- Demonstrated proficiency in Tableau for designing user-friendly and insightful data visualizations.
- Developed skills in KPI management and dashboard design, which are valuable for data-driven decision-making.
